I participated solo under the team name **Code Impact** and won the Best High School Submission award for my work on creating an infographic based on the provided dataset.

## Dataset: World Food Programme
The dataset provided by the World Food Programme (WFP) includes temporal observations of food insecurity levels in Yemen, as well as secondary data such as market prices and weather conditions. The WFP's mission is to deliver emergency food relief and work with communities to build resilience.

## Infographic Submission
The infographic presents key insights from the provided data, focusing on visualizing temporal trends in food insecurity and its correlation with rainfall and market prices in Yemen.

## Objective
The goal was to explore the correlation between:
- **Average Rainfall per Year**: Impact on food insecurity in Yemen
- **Food Insecurity**: Variations over time and across regions
- **Market Prices**: Influence on food insecurity, especially during adverse weather conditions

## Insights
- **Rainfall vs. Food Insecurity**: Fluctuations in rainfall correlate with changes in food insecurity levels, impacted by regional factors.
- **Market Prices**: Significant effects on food insecurity, especially in challenging weather conditions.
